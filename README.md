Problem Description

Despite the rising urgency of climate change and environmental degradation, environmental education remains largely theoretical in many Indian schools and colleges. Students are often taught textbook-based content with little emphasis on real-world application, local ecological issues, or personal responsibility.

There is a lack of engaging tools that motivate students to adopt eco-friendly practices or understand the direct consequences of their lifestyle choices. Traditional methods fail to instill sustainable habits or inspire youth participation in local environmental efforts.
